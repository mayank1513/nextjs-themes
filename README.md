# Nextjs-Themes [![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/next-themes.svg?colorB=green)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nextjs-themes)

This project is inspired by next-themes. Next-themes is an awesome package, however, it requires wraping eveything in a provider. Provider has to be a client component as it uses hooks. And thus, it takes away all the benefits of Server Components.

- ✅ Designed for excellence
- ✅ Unleash the full power of React18 Server components
- ✅ Perfect dark mode in 2 lines of code
- ✅ System setting with prefers-color-scheme
- ✅ Themed browser UI with color-scheme
- ✅ Support for Next.js 13 `appDir`
- ✅ No flash on load (both SSR and SSG)
- ✅ Sync theme across tabs and windows
- ✅ Disable flashing when changing themes
- ✅ Force pages to specific themes
- ✅ Class or data attribute selector
- ✅ `useTheme` hook

$ npm install next-themes
