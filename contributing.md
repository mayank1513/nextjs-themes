## Overview

### Included Utilities

This project is configured with a suite of pre-configured tools to enhance development experience:

- **Monorepo setup with TurboRepo**:
  - TurboRepo provides efficient builds and caching, reducing unnecessary rebuilds.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting.
- A Plop-based code generator for easy component scaffolding.
- Workflows for testing, documentation, dependency updates, and deployment of docs and packages.
- Build setup for generating both CJS and ESM builds to support React 18 server and client component exports from the same library.
- Native support for SCSS modules in `lib` and `packages/shared`.

### Apps and Packages

This TurboRepo includes the following packages/examples, all in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):
